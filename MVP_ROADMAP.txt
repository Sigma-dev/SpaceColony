Add that it snaps to the planet when close enough
Add that if there is no collision, the preview becomes valid
Add that it is only valid if there is the correct amount of resources stored on the planet, show the amount stored on the planet when building
Add that the sawmill can be placed, and store the trees that it has in range in a list
Add working production and storage to the sawmill, and make it visible
Add upgrading the sawmill, which increases it's size and production per tree but is blocked if there are things too close or there are not enough resources.
Add a penalty for sawmills sharing the same trees, penalty shouldn't make it completely un-worth it to stack sawmills though.
Add mountains
Add rockmills that work like sawmills but for mountains, except they penalize the presence of another rockmill instead of mountain sharing
Add storages, they automatically get the excess resource from buildings (for now add a extra stored bool to the producers, and the storages query for producers nearby and get their excess)
