Add that it shows what trees are in range by blinking V
Add that the sawmill can be placed, and store the trees that it has in range in a list V
Add working production and storage to the sawmill, and make it visible V
Add upgrading the sawmill, which increases it's size and production per tree but is blocked if there are things too close or there are not enough resources.
Add a penalty for sawmills sharing the same trees, penalty shouldn't make it completely un-worth it to stack sawmills though.
Add minimalist hud for buildings keys/costs so that a new player could understand it
Add building removal
Fix trees overlapping
Cleanup all the unused code and regroup all components/modules/plugins into a folder hiearchy (ex: planet_stuff/sticker_stuff/buildings_stuff)
Also cleanup the data logic, like how building properties are stored.
Add mountains
Add rockmills that work like sawmills but for mountains, except they penalize the presence of another rockmill instead of mountain sharing
Add storages, they automatically get the excess resource from buildings (for now add a extra stored bool to the producers, and the storages query for producers nearby and get their excess)
Add laboratories and a basic ui for the tree.
Add iron miners
Add smelters
Add Space port and new colony creation
