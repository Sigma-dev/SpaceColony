Space_colony features

Spawning stuff in non obstructed places (Precursor to Resource Spawning):
Spawn water first then spawn trees by trying random spots x amount of times;

Resource spawning:
Instead of static resources, go the forager way ?
Adds more micromanagement unless new assignement system (assign to building then he cuts the tress around it automatically ?)
For the spawning: runs for each planet, find a random free spot and spawns it

Fix water:
Doesn't work between 270 and 360

Fix pathing:
shouldn't be able to start path to inecassible stuff
